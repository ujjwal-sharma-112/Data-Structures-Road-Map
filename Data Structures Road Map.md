Unlike arrays which have a size, linked lists can be dynamically resized during runtime, which offers significant advantages when dealing with large amounts of data Linked lists are commonly used in computer programs to implement various data structures, such as stacks and queues. They are used in many applications, including image processing, computer networking, and databases. how linked lists work and how to use them effectively is an skill for any programmer interested in software development.

#### Stacks

A stack is a linear structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) mechanism for adding and removing elements. It means that the most added item is the first one be removed. The stack is an abstract data type that is widely used in programming languages, operating systems, and data management systems. push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, while the pop operation removes the top element. A typical use case for the stack is the undo-redo, where the user can go back and forth in the sequence of actions performed. Another example is the call stack, where function calls are added the stack and removed in reverse order, allowing the program to keep track of the execution flow.

Undirected Graphs, known as simply 'graphs', are a fundamental data structure used computer science to model a set of objects with pairwise connections. Each object is represented by a vertex node, while the connections between pairs of objects are represented by edges. Unlike in directed graphs, where edges have a direction, edges in an undirected graph do not have a specific direction. This means that if there is an edge connecting vertex A to vertex B, there also an edge connecting vertex B to vertex A. Undirected graphs can be used to represent a wide range of relationships, from social to road networks, and can analyzed using a variety of techniques to extract useful information.

##### Weighted Graphs

Weighted graphs, also as networks, are a type of graph in which each edge is assigned a numerical weight. These graphs are used to model situations where there is a cost or distance with each connection between vertices. In a weighted graph, the shortest path between two vertices is not necessarily the path with the fewest edges, but the path with the smallest total weight.ed graphs can be used in many applications, such as network, routing algorithms, and resource allocation.
